              <b>Hey there!</b> Welcome to the very first blog of Hack Club
              COET, a place full of possibilities. So you're probably wondering
              what this club is and how we operate as a community. Don't worry
              we got your back so letâ€™s get started!!
            </p>

              <h4>WHAT IS HACKCLUB</h4>

              <p>
                Hack Club COET is a platform for students who are interested in
                learning, sharing and growing together as a community.Â  Its main
                aim is to create a network where students feel free to come and
                learn from other students, basically a community made by the
                students for the students. We present a very friendly and
                chilled out environment for our members and we make sure that
                your skills in coding, designing or whatever your area of
                interest is upgraded to a newer and stronger version.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h4>WHY DID WE START THIS CLUB AT OUR COLLEGE?</h4>

            <p>
              Letâ€™s take a trip down memory lane to the time when our college
              had students with close to zero technical knowledge and a growing
              desire to learn programming. A small team of 15 members took it
              upon themselves to solve this problem and as a result hack club
              community was built in our college from scratch. We at Hack club
              are building a platform that helps you to be an expert in your
              field of interest and also to feed your hunger for knowledge on
              all things technical.
            </p>

            <h4>FROM IDEA TO REALITY</h4>
            <p>
              For those who are wondering this was not an easy slide down the
              hill, rather an uphill climb with lots of rejections and
              brainstorming. On May 25th 2021 Hack club COET was formed and we
              opened its doors to fellow interested students, with over 160+
              registrations we went full steam ahead. So what was the criteria
              for accepting these registrations? Absolutely NOTHING,as we said
              earlier this is a free space for every student regardless of their
              knowledge in coding.Every student who had registered for the club
              was called up by our team and sorted into two groups â€“designing
              and coding based on their area of interest.
            </p>

            <div class="col-md-8">
              <h4>WHAT HAVE WE ACCOMPLISHED?</h4>

              <p>
                After such an overwhelming response from the students, we
                decided to sort through all these students and select the kind
                of crackheads we need in hack club in order to build a strong
                team,and this was the start of our very first event
                "Reconstruir:"This event is being conducted as we speak in 4
                levels-:
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>LEVEL 0</b>-TTo build our coding team we needed our members
                to have some sort of idea about the subject .So, we decided to
                start from a very basic coding language python. The crowd was
                divided into sub groups with each group having a mentor among
                themselves. The mentors were trained in python just a week
                before other members .We set up a collaboration with snakify
                where a set of lessons in python were assigned for our
                members.The members had to complete each lesson within the given
                time, starting from 1st June 2021 to 25th June 2021 in order to
                complete level 0.The students and mentors worked together and
                let me tell you the response was amazing! A total of 98/100
                students completed the challenge within the due date and those
                who didnâ€™t were evicted from the group.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-4">
              <img
                class="blog-inner-image"
                src="..\images\blogs\blog1\game over.jpeg"
              />
            </div>

            <p>
              Level 0 has been completed as of 25th June 2021,now we will move
              ahead with our plans for further levels which will be conducted as
              follows-:
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>LEVEL 1</b>-To put their basic skills in python to the test the
              members who cleared level 0 would be divided into small groups of
              4-5 people. A beginner level project would be assigned to these
              groups and they have to complete the project within a span of 4-5
              days. Their mentors would be with them every step of the way
              helping them in every way possible.If the team succeeds in the
              given challenge they move on to the next level while others are
              eliminated.
            </p>
            <p>
              We assure every member of having a fun filled learning experience
              with us at Hack club COET , where everyone is free to articulate
              their sense of logic. We have a whale of time here, communicating
              regularly with team members and building a warm fellowship with
              each other. We ponder,dream up and wrap up our needs through our
              team. If you are engrossed in brainstorming with us, don't drive
              away, we'll effectuate together and hit the jackpot!
            </p>
